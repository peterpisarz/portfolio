            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Active blockchain developer with a deep interest in NFT technology.
                As a former aerospace engineer, I found my career disrupted during the pandemic.
                With commercial air travel down over 90%, I knew it was time to 
                learn new skills. I had purchased some of my first crypto but admitted to
                myself that I really didn't understand the tech side so I began taking tutorials
                online via Dapp University. I had an interest in programming since high school
                and found it fun to return to those skills. My first project was developing my
                own token and decentralized exchange. While I found this interesting and a great
                learning experience, it wasn't until I got involved with NFTs that my
                enthusiasm had piqued. I've created NFT projects with art generators and have
                uploaded much of my photography on opensea. I'm currently developing a
                batch uploader for photographers such as myself. It's a great unity of my
                logic side and artistic side, but I'm always searching for new NFT use cases.
                I can see huge potential for the NFT space in music, real estate, sports and 
                beyond!
