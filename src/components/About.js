            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As a former aerospace engineer, I found my career disrupted during the pandemic.
                With commercial air travel down over 90%, I knew it was time to 
                learn new skills. I had purchased some of my first cryptocurrencies but admitted to
                myself that I really didn't understand the tech side so I began taking tutorials
                online via Dapp University.<br/><br/>
                I had an interest in programming since high school
                and found it fun to return to those skills. My first project was developing my
                own token and decentralized exchange. After completing this project, I got involved with NFTs. 
                I've created NFT projects with art generators and have
                uploaded much of my photography on opensea.<br/><br/> 
                I moved on from tutorials to develop my own projects completely from scratch. Most recently is my Tournament Project
                which organizes an eight man sports bracket I developed for jiu jitsu athletes. It's entirely a product
                of my own ideas and logic which I am refining to be used in real life. It's a way of collecting registration fees
                and distributing them to the tournament promoter and winner of the bracket. Please explore, provide feedback and reach
                out to discuss further!
